# ðŸš€ End-to-End DevOps Implementation on an E-Commerce Project

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Modern e-commerce applications demand **rapid, reliable, and scalable delivery pipelines**. However, many organizations still rely on **manual provisioning**, **ad-hoc deployments**, and **inconsistent CI/CD workflows**, leading to:

- Slow release cycles  
- Configuration drift and infrastructure errors  
- Inefficient onboarding for new engineers  
- Lack of visibility and automation across environments  

This project aims to address these challenges by implementing a **complete DevOps pipeline** â€” from infrastructure provisioning to production deployment â€” using **AWS, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes (EKS), GitHub Actions, and ArgoCD**.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To design and deploy a fully automated DevOps workflow for an e-commerce application, covering:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with **Terraform**
- Containerization with **Docker**
- Cluster orchestration using **Kubernetes**
- CI/CD pipelines via **GitHub Actions**
- GitOps-based deployment using **ArgoCD**
- Domain management and SSL/TLS setup via **Route53**

### âœ… Expected Outcomes

- End-to-end automated delivery pipeline from code commit â†’ production  
- Scalable, reproducible, and secure cloud infrastructure  
- Hands-on understanding of DevOps tools and real-world workflows  
- Production-ready portfolio project for interviews and learning
